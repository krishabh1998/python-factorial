# Factorial

You now know that it is posible to call a Python function from somewhere of your code, however a function can call itself and this is known as **recursi√≥n**.

The goal of this project is to make a program that calculates the factorial of a number by using recursion. 

      Nota: It is important that you understand what is recursion, because it might come helpful while you are using it at your project.


## Basic concepts 

      1.  Recursion
      2.  Documentation 
      3.  Functions



## Executing the Test
Go to your project directory and execute `nosetests` on the terminal. The code should work perfectly.


## Sample 

def recur_factorial(n):                                   #create a function to return the factorial of a number.
   if n == 1:
       return n
   else:
       return n*recur_factorial(n-1)
